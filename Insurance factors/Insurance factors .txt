Insurance factors 
identification



Objective
Analyze the real influence on the claims of the risk arguments 
and compare this structure with the actual tariff


Description

The data gives the details of third-party motor insurance claims in Sweden 
for the year 1977. In Sweden, all motor insurance companies apply 
identical risk arguments to classify customers, and thus their portfolios 
and their claims statistics can be combined. The data were compiled by a 
Swedish Committee on the Analysis of Risk Premium in Motor Insurance. 
The Committee was asked to investigate the problem of analyzing the real 
influence on the claims of the risk arguments and to compare this 
structure with the actual tariff.

following using the R tool:

• The total value of payment by an insurance company is an important 
factor to be monitored. 
• To figure out the reasons for insurance payment increase and 
decrease. 
• What affects their claim rates

claims are affecting the payment
2. Find at what location, kilometer, and bonus level their insured amount, 
claims, and payment gets increased.
