College Admission




Description

Every year thousands of applications are being submitted by international 
students for admission to colleges in the USA. It becomes an iterative task 
for the Education Department to know the total number of applications 
received and then compare that data with the total number of applications 
successfully accepted and visas processed. Hence to make the entire 
process easy, the education department in the US analyzes the factors 
that influence the admission of a student into colleges
